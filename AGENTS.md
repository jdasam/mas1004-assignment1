# Notes for coding agents

## Running Python in this repository

Run every Python command through uv, from the repository folder:

```
uv run pytest tests/test_data.py
uv run python src/collect.py --classes "espresso cup,wine glass,paper coffee cup" --n 150
uv run python src/run.py
```

uv reads `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, downloads Python 3.12 itself, and
installs the exact version of every package into `.venv`. The first run takes a
few minutes. Do not activate `.venv` or call its Python directly.

- Do not use `pip install`, `python -m venv`, conda, or the `python` or
  `python3` that is already on the computer.
- Do not change versions in `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` or `requirements.txt`,
  and do not run `uv add`, `uv remove` or `uv lock --upgrade`. `ddgs` and
  `primp` in particular are pinned on purpose: other versions crash on macOS or
  fail to search, and `src/collect.py` stops if it finds any other version.

If `uv` is not found, install it with the official installer, then close the
terminal and quit and reopen VS Code so the new `PATH` is picked up:

- macOS or Linux: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Windows, in PowerShell:
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

If uv stops with one of these errors, stop and tell the student. Do not try to
work around it with pip or other versions.

- `The current Python platform is not compatible with the lockfile's supported
  environments`: this is an Intel Mac or a Windows computer with an ARM
  processor. PyTorch has no packages for them. Use Google Colab with
  `assignment1_colab.ipynb`.
- `can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel
  for the current platform` on a Mac: macOS is older than 14 (Sonoma). Update
  macOS, or use Google Colab.

## On Google Colab

uv is not used on Colab. `assignment1_colab.ipynb` installs with
`pip install -q -r requirements.txt` and runs `python ...` directly.

Colab is only for running things. The notebook takes the code from the
student's repository on GitHub and replaces anything edited on Colab. So code
changes are made here, on the student's computer, then committed and pushed,
and the student brings them over with section 9 of the notebook. Never tell the
student to edit code on Colab. The model files that `src/export_web.py` writes
on Colab come back here to be committed and published.
